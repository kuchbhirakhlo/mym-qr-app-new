# Security Updates

## Firebase Configuration Security

We've made important security improvements to protect sensitive Firebase configuration details:

### 1. Environment Variables

Firebase configuration has been moved from hardcoded values in `lib/firebase.ts` to environment variables:

```javascript
// Before (insecure)
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyAp8LeVXNMaJZ5jovQOJ4meZap18LD99ck",
  authDomain: "menu-app-11626.firebaseapp.com",
  // Other config values...
};

// After (secure)
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  // Other config values from environment...
};
```

### 2. Removed Sensitive Logging

We've removed the logging of sensitive Firebase configuration details:

```javascript
// Before (insecure)
console.log("Initializing Firebase with config:", JSON.stringify({
  apiKey: firebaseConfig.apiKey,
  authDomain: firebaseConfig.authDomain,
  projectId: firebaseConfig.projectId,
  storageBucket: firebaseConfig.storageBucket,
}));

// After (secure)
console.log("Initializing Firebase...");
```

### 3. Environment Files

- Created `.env.local` with actual Firebase configuration
- Added `.env.example` as a template without sensitive values
- Updated `.gitignore` to ensure sensitive environment files aren't committed

### 4. Next Steps

While these changes improve security, consider these additional steps:

1. **Firebase Security Rules**: Ensure your Firestore security rules are properly configured
2. **API Key Restrictions**: Set up API key restrictions in the Google Cloud Console
3. **Regular Rotation**: Consider regularly rotating credentials for enhanced security
4. **Environment Separation**: Use different Firebase projects for development and production

### 5. Important Note

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix means these variables will be included in the client-side JavaScript bundle. This is necessary for Firebase client SDK, but be aware that these values will be visible in the browser. This is an expected limitation of client-side Firebase authentication.

For additional security:
- Set up Firebase Authentication properly
- Configure Firebase Security Rules to control data access
- Set API key restrictions in the Google Cloud Console
